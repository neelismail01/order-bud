# Order-bud

## Inspiration & Description
During this pandemic as businesses were being forced to shut down, it became increasingly important to support the small businesses in our neighbourhood. 
I thought this was an important and impactful action we could all take to support the entrepreneurs in our community who were struggling due to no fault of
their own. As I needed new goods, such as sporting equipment and clothes, throughout the pandemic, I found it difficult to find small businesses near me that
sold the goods I was looking for. This inspired me to build OrderBud, a mobile app marketplace exclusively designed for small businesses.

Users of OrderBud can enter their address and discover all small businesses on the platform within a 30km radius of them. Users can explore the menus of all
the businesses and purchase products from their store through the app. I also developed extensive search capabilities to enable users to easily find the 
products they are looking for. The search features in the app supported queries for product categories, business names, and individual products on the platform. 
I also thought it was important for business owners to be able to manage their business through the app, so I built capabilities for them to create 
store profiles, add and remove products, manage inventory, and view sales performance.

## Technologies
I built the frontend of this application using **React Native** and used **Redux** to manage state in the app. I built the backend of this application using
**Node.js** and **Express.js** and used **MongoDB** as my database technology. In order to serve geographically relevant content, I used the **Google Distance Matrix API**
and the **Google Places API**.
